A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the 50  items with orthogonal rotation (varimax).  Bartlett’s test of sphericity, Χ2(253) = 8165.92, p< .001, indicated that correlations between items were sufficiently large for PCA.  An initial analysis was run to obtain eigenvalues for each component in the data.  eleven components had eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion of 1 and in combination explained 30.43% of the variance.  The scree plot was slightly ambiguous and showed inflexions that would justify retaining either 6 or 9 factors.  
Given the large sample size, and the convergence of the scree plot and Kaiser’s criterion on six components, six components were retained in the final analysis.
