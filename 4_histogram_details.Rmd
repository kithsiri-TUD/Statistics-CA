## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. this is using to display how to generate the histograms of different values. this R file shows the histograms based on mG1. first few code block just generate the  hisotram based on all the records. and later histograms were generated based on category of 
sex,internet and school as well.

following code snippet is using to load the data 

```{r}
# dataset is loading and converting the character based data types to factors
setwd('D:/statistics')
df = read.csv('sperformance-dataset.csv',stringsAsFactors = F)

# converting the character type into factorial variables and see the conversion
indices <- c(1,2,4:6,9:14,18:23,34,38:43)

for(i in indices)
{
  df[[i]] <- as.factor(df[[i]])
}

```

following code  file just display the normal histogram generation of the mG1 value - math grade 1
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p<-ggplot(df, aes(x=mG1)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white")

p+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(mG1)),
            color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1)

```
then  the following line shows the histogram generation for the same mG1 with Density curve

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=mG1)) + 
 geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="black", fill="white")+
 geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") 

```

then the following line display mG1 histogram based on school category

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x=mG1,color=ï..school,fill=ï..school)) + 
 geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), fill="white")+
 geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") 

```
then the following line display mG1 histogram based on sex category. there are two schools.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=mG1,color=sex,fill=sex)) + 
 geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), fill="white")+
 geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") 

```


check the histogram based on the internet 

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x=mG1,color=internet,fill=internet)) + 
 geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), fill="white")+
 geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") 

```
