In this experiment I'm going to look at an answer for the following question and for the hypothesis tests.

Question:
Is there a significant difference in the mean protuguese first period score for respondants for respondents who have internet access and those who do not
based on the question following hypothesis will be tested.

Hypothesis (Two-tailed)
H0: There is no difference in protuguese first period score for respondants for respondents who have internet access and those who do not
HA: There is a difference in  protuguese first period score for respondants for respondents who have internet access and those who do not

as the first step following code is used to load the dataset

```{r}

setwd('D:/statistics')
# dataset is loading and converting the character based data types to factors
df = read.csv('sperformance-dataset.csv',stringsAsFactors = F)

# converting the character type into factorial variables and see the conversion
indices <- c(1,2,4:6,9:14,18:23,34,38:43)

for(i in indices)
{
  df[[i]] <- as.factor(df[[i]])
}

```
After loading the dataset following codeblock will install all the relavant libraries. Moreover allthe column names convert into simple before it runs.

```{r}

#Setting the column names to be that used in the dataset but in lowercase to make life a bit easier
colnames(df) <- tolower(colnames(df))
#Remember to install these packages if you haven't already done so

needed_packages <- c("pastecs", "ggplot2", "psych", "semTools", "FSA", "car", "coin", "rstatix")                      
# Extract not installed packages
not_installed <- needed_packages[!(needed_packages %in% installed.packages()[ , "Package"])]    
# Install not installed packages
if(length(not_installed)) install.packages(not_installed) 

library(pastecs) #For creating descriptive statistic summaries
library(ggplot2) #For creating histograms with more detail than plot
library(psych) # Some useful descriptive functions
library(semTools) #For skewness and kurtosis
library(FSA) #For percentage
library(car) # For Levene's test for homogeneity of variance 
library(effectsize) #To calculate effect size for t-test

```
# Check the Normality for the maths first period Variable

```{r}
#We will allocate the histogram to a variable to allow use to manipulate it
gg <- ggplot(df, aes(x=pg1))

#Change the label of the x axis
gg <- gg + labs(x="students maths grade(first period)")

#manage binwidth and colours
gg <- gg + geom_histogram(binwidth=2, colour="blue", aes(y=..density.., fill=..count..))
gg <- gg + scale_fill_gradient("Count", low="#DCDCDC", high="#7C7C7C")
gg
#adding a normal curve
#use stat_function to compute a normalised score for each value of tpcoiss
#pass the mean and standard deviation
#use the na.rm parameter to say how missing values are handled
gg <- gg + stat_function(fun=dnorm, color="red",args=list(mean=mean(df$pg1, na.rm=TRUE), sd=sd(df$pg1, na.rm=TRUE)))

#to display the graph request the contents of the variable be shown
gg

```
above charts visually shows that the dataset is normal distribution. then for further clarification do q-q plot.

```{r}
#Create a qqplot
qqnorm(df$pg1)
qqline(df$pg1, col=2) #show a line on the plot


```
it shows that the values are fallen to the straight line. it depicts that it has a normal distribution,

 further with the following function I'm looking for summary statistic for the same variable pg1

```{r}

#stat.desc is a function from pastecs - make sure you include the basic switch=F to ensure you don't get scienfitic notation
pastecs::stat.desc(df$pg1, basic=F)

```

eventhough it is not skew, for further confirmation of normal distribution, we are going to calculate Standardized skewness and kurtosis and the Percentage of standardized scores falling within acceptable ranges
as the first step we are going to calcuate the Standardized skewness and kurtosis.Standardised scores (value/std.error) for skewness between +/-2 (1.96 rounded) are considered acceptable in order to prove normal univariate distribution. 

```{r}
#We can make our decision based on the value of the standardised score for skew and kurtosis
#We divide the skew statistic by the standard error to get the standardised score
#This will indicate if we have a problem
tpskew<-semTools::skew(df$mg1)
tpkurt<-semTools::kurtosis(df$mg1)
tpskew[1]/tpskew[2]

tpkurt[1]/tpkurt[2]

```
as shown with the above result it seems that kurosis and skew didn't appear with in acceptable range. therefore here with I'm going to calculate the Percentage of standardized scores falling within acceptable ranges. 

```{r}

#and by calculating the percentage of standardised scores for the variable itself that are outside our acceptable range
#This will tell us how big a problem we have
# Calculate the percentage of standardised scores that are greated than 1.96
# the perc function which is part of the FSA package which calculate the percentage that are within a range - you can look for greater than "gt", greater than or equal "geq", "gt", less than or equal "leq",  or less than "lt"),
# scale is a function that creates z scores, abs gets absolute value

df_pg1<- abs(scale(df$pg1))

FSA::perc(as.numeric(df_pg1), 1.96, "gt")
FSA::perc(as.numeric(df_pg1), 3.29, "gt")

```


so  values fall outside +/- 1.96 (ignoring missing data) is 4.71% of our data Since the data is larger than 80 cases we can use +/- 3.29 as our measure 0.26% of our data So it is ok to treat as normal for the pg1
variable. 


# doing two sample t-test based on mean protuguese first period score for respondants for respondents who have internet access and those who do not

```{r}

#Get descriptive stastitics by group - output as a matrix
psych::describeBy(df$pg1, df$internet, mat=TRUE)

#Conduct Levene's test for homogeneity of variance in library car - the null hypothesis is that variances in groups are equal so to assume homogeneity we woudl expect probaility to not be statistically significant.
car::leveneTest(pg1 ~ df$internet, data=df)
#Pr(>F) is your probability - in this case it is not statistically significant so we can assume homogeneity


#Conduct the t-test from package stats
#In this case we can use the var.equal = TRUE option to specify equal variances and a pooled variance estimate

stats::t.test(pg1~df$internet,var.equal=TRUE,data=df)



```
estimating the effect size of the test

```{r}
res <- stats::t.test(pg1~internet,var.equal=TRUE,data=df)
#Calculate Cohen's d
#artithmetically
effcd=round((2*res$statistic)/sqrt(res$parameter),2)

#Using function from effectsize package
effectsize::t_to_d(t = res$statistic, res$parameter)


#Eta squared calculation
effes=round((res$statistic*res$statistic)/((res$statistic*res$statistic)+(res$parameter)),3)
effes

```
Accoring to the above investigation following conclusion were taken..

â€œAn independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare mean protuguese first period score for respondants for respondents who have internet access and those who do not .  significant difference in the scores for protuguese first period was found (M=11.63, SD= 3.20 for respondant who do not have internet access, M= 12.19, SD= 2.41 for respondents who has internet access), (t(380)= -2.44, p = 0.01). A very small effect size was also indicted by the eta squared value (0.006).
