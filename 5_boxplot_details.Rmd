## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. this is using to display how to generate the boxplots of different values. this R file shows the box plot based on mG1. first few code block just generate the  boxplot based on all the records. and later boxplots were generated based on category of 
sex,internet and school as well.

```{r}
# dataset is loading and converting the character based data types to factors

setwd('D:/statistics')
df = read.csv('sperformance-dataset.csv',stringsAsFactors = F)

# converting the character type into factorial variables and see the conversion
indices <- c(1,2,4:6,9:14,18:23,34,38:43)

for(i in indices)
{
  df[[i]] <- as.factor(df[[i]])
}

```


following code  just display the basic boxplot of the mG1 value - math grade 1


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Basic box plot
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=sex, y=mG1)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
p

```
check the mG1 with out lier values. generated graphs shows that there are no outliers

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x=sex, y=mG1)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8,
                outlier.size=4)

```
box plot for mG1 variable with dotted line is displayed here.

```{r}
p + geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', stackdir='center', dotsize=1)
```
following code display the box plot generated  for multiple grouping. this example just show the
grouping based on sex and internet.

```{r}

# Change box plot colors by groups
p<-ggplot(df, aes(x=sex, y=mG1, fill=internet)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# Change the position

p

```
following code display the box plot generated  for multiple grouping. this example just show the
grouping based on Fjob

```{r}

p<-ggplot(df, aes(x=Fjob, y=mG1, color=Fjob)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# Change the position
p
```
generate the box plot based on mother job

```{r}

p<-ggplot(df, aes(x=Mjob, y=mG1, color=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# Change the position
p

```
